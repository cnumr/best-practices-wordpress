# No-code → Everyone

## Profile:

- You need to create a website (or e-commerce site) and you are aware that the digital impact is not zero ([4% of global GHG emissions](https://www.greenit.fr/etude-empreinte-environnementale-du-numerique-mondial/)) ;
- You need information, but you are not a developer or at least not a web development expert. So you need adapted and understandable information.

### You identify with these statements:

> **NO-CODE** → not a developer, who is not even technical and has no knowledge of basic best practices.
> Using a pretty theme that responds to their needs (or even embedding more than these needs) and "thousands" of plugins for everything and anything, a page builder.

### If this is the case:

Great, you're in the right place. Each sheet tells you and explains a problem and how to solve it with a solution adapted to you.

### If this is not the case:

Don't worry, there will be a solution for each profile. There is one for everyone!
