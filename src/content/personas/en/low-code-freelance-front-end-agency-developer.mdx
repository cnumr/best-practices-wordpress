# Low-code → Freelance and Front-End Agency Developer

### Profile:

- You need to create a website (or e-commerce site) for yourself or for one of your clients and you or they are aware that the digital impact is not zero ([4% of global GHG emissions](https://www.greenit.fr/etude-empreinte-environnementale-du-numerique-mondial/)) ;
- You need to deliver quickly while keeping environmental impacts under control as much as possible ;
- You need the right information quickly and applicable without deviating from your quote ;
- You want to know all the points to check, from design to delivery ;
- However, you are not a developer, so you need adapted and understandable information.

### You identify with these statements:

> **LOW-CODE** → They have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, they use a bit of PHP code as a patch or to link plugins. They use a pretty theme (or one they will make pretty) and respond to their needs or their client's needs (or even embedding more than the identified needs) and "hundreds" of plugins and often a page builder.

### If this is the case:

Great, you're in the right place. Each sheet tells you and explains a problem and how to solve it with a solution adapted to you.

### If this is not the case:

Don't worry, there will be a solution for each profile. There is one for everyone!
